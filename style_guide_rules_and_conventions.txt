====================Style Guide Rules and Conventions====================

~~~~~~~~~~Naming~~~~~~~~~~
Within code:

	lowercase_with_underscores = variable names

	underscores_With_Camel_Case = data structure names (class type objects not included)

	camelCase = function names 

	PascalCase = class type object definition names 
	
	
Files and directories:
	
	-avoid spaces in file and directory names
	 
	-avoid capitalization in file names 
	 use underscores between words
	 
	-use camel case for directory names (the project directory being an exception)
